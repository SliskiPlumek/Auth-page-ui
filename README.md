# Authorization page - User Interface

This is a front-end side of my auth app which is linked to rest api. Made with vue including vuex. The vue code might be pretty ugly because i just started learning it, i mainly focused on the backend api to practise my skills.

## How to run

Use npm to install all needed dependencies.

```bash
npm i
```
Then type:

```bash
npm run serve
```
## API is provided in the other repo
